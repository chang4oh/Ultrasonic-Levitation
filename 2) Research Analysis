Atom went through many iterations and after finding out that it wasn't going to work out 
I decided to work on object control from external source instead of individual objects. 

This I tried all sources of energy input ranging from
thermal reactant movement, 
infrared & humidity controlled from static field, 
infrared reactant material (foam), 
and ferrofluid control from magnet.

The concept I couldn't wrap my head around ranging from
blowing precision air in a encased cylinder containing foam balls
pyrolytic graphite floating over neoydynium magnet (very expensive)
light reactant material

These experiments didn't give out the precision output needed to control objects. 
With modification with one of my early entry to microbot (MFP), I envisioned the best
object control comes from ultrasonic sound. It has power to move and lift objects,
but also very complex and precision controlled.
