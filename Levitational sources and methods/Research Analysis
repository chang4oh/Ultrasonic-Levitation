Atom went through many iterations and after finding out that it wasn't going to work out I decided to work on object control
from external source instead of individual objects. This I tried all sources of energy input ranging from
thermal reactant movement, infrared & humidity controlled from static field, light reactant material, and ferrofluid control from magnet. 
These inputs didn't give out the precision output needed to control objects.
