Atom went through many iterations and after finding out that it wasn't going to work out 
I decided to work on object control from external source instead of individual objects. 
This I tried all sources of energy input ranging from
thermal reactant movement, 
infrared & humidity controlled from static field, 
light reactant material, 
and ferrofluid control from magnet. 

These inputs didn't give out the precision output needed to control objects. 
With modification with one of my early entry to microbot, I envisioned the best
object control comes from ultrasonic sound. It has power to move and lift objects,
but also very complex and precision controlled. Not to mention costs going over my
estimates.
