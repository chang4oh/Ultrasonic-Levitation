I deisgned (1A) model tennis ball encased plastic shell with neodynium magnet. This is to
represent modified Atom Ball with defensive shell with inside function that can bounce rather 
than impact damege from drops and collision from other objects while maintaining balanced
magnetic attraction from each other Balls.

I designed (1P) cardboard model with the concept of static electricity plate controlled by
infrared direction of each sticks to create complex geometry of lines that objects trace.
Plate has hole size of mini styrofoam ball which the plate powered from the connected
ring of static generator. Under the plate has styrofoam reserve, waiting to be activated 
to trace the lines.

Ultrasonic levitation is a major goal I have in mind for object levitation.
